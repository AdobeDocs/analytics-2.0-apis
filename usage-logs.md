# Usage Logs API Guide

The Usage Log API is an Analytics Reporting API that allows users to retrieve the usage and access log data provided within the Logs tool. 

We recommend using the [Reporting APIs in the Swagger UI](https://adobedocs.github.io/analytics-2.0-apis/?urls.primaryName=Reporting%20APIs) to learn how to make this API call.

## Authorization and Authentication

In order to use this API, you must have the appropriate permissions. Admin users will have permissions to the tool by default. Non-admin users must be given the following '*Analytics Tools*' permission in the [Admin Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-console/permissions/analytics-tools.html?lang=en#admin-console): "*Logs - Web Services*".

This API authenticates the same way as the other Analytics Reporting APIs. For complete details on that authentication process, please see the [Getting Started Guide for 2.0 APIs](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/create-oauth-client.md).

### Event Type Lookup Table

By default, all event types will be included when you make a request to get usage logs. To apply a filter for a specific event type, the ID can be used in the API request. These event types are the same fields available in the [Analytics UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/logs.html?lang=en#section_8ADE8A7204A8401C968ABC20AECA381D).
