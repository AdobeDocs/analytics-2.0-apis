# Import API Classifications by uploading files

This guide includes instructions for importing JSON classification datasets that are larger than 50 MB, or that include a .tsv or .tab file. With this method, a dataset is uploaded as a file with the POST request. Alternatively, your dataset can be imported as a JSON body of the POST request if it is smaller than 50MB. For more information on this alternative, see the [Analytics classification APIs](classifications/index.md) guide.

Additionally, using these endpoints requires your global company ID in each request. If you receive the response error message "Cannot find proper global company ID," add the following header to your requests: `x-proxy-global-company-id:{GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID}`. You can find your global company ID by using the [Discovery API](../discovery.md).

To import an API classification by uploading a file, you follow a three-step process:

1. Create an import job with the [POST create job](#post-create-job) endpoint.
2. Upload a file using the [PUT upload file](#put-upload-file) endpoint.
3. Commit your upload using the [POST commit job](#post-commit-job) endpoint.

The endpoints described in this guide are routed through analytics.adobe.io. To use them, you will need to first create a client with access to the Adobe Developer Console. For more information, refer to [Getting started with the Analytics API](src/pages/guides/endpoints/classifications/index.md).

## POST create job

Use this endpoint to create an import job for a classification dataset. Creating an import job is required to produce a job ID that can be associated with an uploaded dataset file. For more information on classification jobs, see [Classification set jobs manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/classifications/sets/job-manager.htm).

`POST https://analytics.adobe.io/api/{GLOBALCOMPANYID}/classification/job/import/createApiJob/{DATASET_ID}`
