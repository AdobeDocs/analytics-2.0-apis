# Metric Mapping API

To map metrics from Adobe Analytics to a Customer Journey Analytics data view within an XDM schema, follow these steps:

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, create the metrics that you want to be mapped from the existing Adobe Analytics metrics.

2. Collect the metric ID information to be used in the mappings. If you have a `csv` file that defines your XDM schema for a data view, it may be helpful to reference it. You can also use the [GET metrics](https://developer.adobe.com/cja-apis/docs/endpoints/metrics/) endpoint to see a list of metrics and their IDs for a data view.

3. Create a `csv` file that contains the mappings for your metrics. Refer to the `csv` example above for dimensions mappings and use the same format for your metrics.

    | aaId | cjaId | note |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | evar5 | cja.evar5 | organization |
    | evar7 | cja.evar7 | page |
    | evar8 | cja.evar8 | product |
    | evar9 | cja.evar9 | day |
              
<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text" />

The `aaId` label, as shown in the example mapping `csv` file above, has different meanings, depending upon endpoint or API service. In the example `csv` above, it is the metric name in Analytics. In the related [Component Migration API service](/src\pages\guides\endpoints\compmigration\index.md), `aaId` is a parameter with a different function. For more information on the difference, see the description for the `aaId` parameter in the [Component Migration API guide](/src\pages\guides\endpoints\compmigration\index.md). 

4. Use the metric mapping APIs below to upload (or create), update, or retrieve the mappings.

5. Use the [Component Migration API](/src\pages\guides\endpoints\compmigration\index.md) to migrate the metrics to CJA.

Use these endpoints to map metrics to CJA within an XDM schema:

* [POST mapping metrics csv](#post-mapping-metrics-csv): Create metrics mappings with a `csv` file
* [GET mapping metrics csv](#get-mapping-metrics-csv): Retrieve metrics mappings with a `csv` file
* [PUT mapping metrics csv](#put-mapping-metric-csv): Update metrics mappings with a `csv` file
* [DELETE mapping metric all](#delete-metric-mapping-all): Delete all metrics mapping

## POST mapping metrics csv
