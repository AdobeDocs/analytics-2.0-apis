# Data Warehouse API

The Analytics 2.0 Data Warehouse API endpoints provide methods for creating and managing Data Warehouse scheduled requests, and for viewing report data regarding those requests. The endpoints use the same data and methods that are used when working with Data Warehouse in the Adobe Analytics UI. See the [Data Warehouse overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/export/data-warehouse/data-warehouse) for more information.

Note that there are no endpoints which will return the data contained within a Data Warehouse report. The contents of your generated Data Warehouse reports are only accessible through the configured report destination. For more information regarding report destinations, see [Configure a report destination for a Data Warehouse request](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/export/data-warehouse/dw-create-request/dw-request-report-destinations).

The endpoints described in this guide are routed through `analytics.adobe.io`. To use them, you must first create a client with access to the Adobe Developer Console. For more information, see [Getting started with the Analytics API](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/) for more information.

This guide includes instructions for using the following endpoints:

* [GET retrieve scheduled requests](#get-retrieve-scheduled-requests): Retrieves summarized information of scheduled requests that match specified filters
* [POST create scheduled request](#post-create-scheduled-request): Creates a scheduled request
* [GET retreive scheduled request by UUID](#get-retrieve-scheduled-request-by-uuid): Retrieves the information of a scheduled request specified by UUID
* [PUT scheduled request update](#put-scheduled-request-update): Updates a scheduled request specified by UUID
* [GET reports](#get-reports): Retrieves the reports generated by a specified scheduled request
* [GET retrieve report by UUID](#get-retrieve-report-by-uuid): Retrieves a report specified by UUID
* [PUT report update](#put-report-update): Updates a report specified by UUID

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text" />

Adobe may add optional request and response members (name/value pairs) to existing API objects at any time and without notice or changes in versioning. Adobe recommends that you refer to the API documentation of any third-party tool you integrate with our APIs so that such additions are ignored in processing if not understood. If implemented properly, such additions are non-breaking changes for your implementation. Adobe will not remove parameters or add required parameters without first providing standard notification through release notes.

## GET retrieve scheduled requests
