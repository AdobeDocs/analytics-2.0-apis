# Cloud Locations API overview

The Adobe Analytics Cloud Locations 2.0 API endpoints provide methods to manage export locations for analytics data. Use this API service to create, read, update, and delete cloud storage accounts and locations for exporting data. 

You can use Cloud Locations APIs for the following:

* Exporting files using Data Feed APIs

* Exporting reports using Data Warehouse APIs

* Working with Classification APIs

This API includes two service categories:

* [**Analytics Cloud Locations Account API**](account.md)

* [**Analytics Cloud Locations Location API**](locations.md)
  
To export data to a cloud location, you must first [create a cloud location account](account.md). After creating the account, you can create as many locations on that account as you need.
