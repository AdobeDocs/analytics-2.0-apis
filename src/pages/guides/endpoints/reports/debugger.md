# Oberon XML and JSON debugger

Analysis Workspace makes calls to the reporting API endpoint to retrieve data. Adobe offers an in-product debugger that lets you see the API calls while in any Workspace project.

## Enable the debugger

Before using the debugger, you must enable it first.

1. Log in to [analytics.adobe.com](https://analytics.adobe.com).
2. Create a new project, or open an existing project.
3. Navigate to **Help** > **Enable debugger**.
4. Click **OK** in the popup modal.

## Using the debugger

A [Bug] icon appears in the top right of each visualization that retrieves data. Click this icon, then click the API call that you want to inspect (typically the Freeform table request).
