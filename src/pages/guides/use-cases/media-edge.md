# Media Edge API use cases

Media Edge API use cases include the following example timelines:

* Two chapters separated by an ad break
* A Buffer state and a pause

Media Edge APIs are built on the Adobe Experience Platform to provide media event tracking data within the framework of [XDM schemas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html#:~:text=Experience%20Data%20Model%20(XDM)%2C,the%20power%20of%20digital%20experiences). For more information, see the [Media Edge API overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge-network-server-api/media-edge-apis/overview.html).

Adobe may add optional request and response members (name/value pairs) to existing API objects at any time and without notice or changes in versioning. Adobe recommends that you refer to the API documentation of any third-party tool you integrate with our APIs so that such additions are ignored in processing if not understood. If implemented properly, such additions are non-breaking changes for your implementation. Adobe will not remove parameters or add required parameters without first providing standard notification through release notes.
