# Media Edge API use cases

Media Edge API use cases include the following example scenarios:

* Two chapters separated by an ad break
* A Buffer State and a Pause



Use case 1
* Two chapters: `Chapter 1` and `Chapter 2`.
* An ad break inserted at the middle of the content that contains two ads: `Ad 1` and `Ad 2`.

In contrast to the [Buffer state and a pause Media Edge use case](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/use-cases/media-edge/buffer-and-pause-timeline/), this example presents a differing offset playhead position in the timeline.

Media Edge APIs are built on the Adobe Experience Platform to provide media event tracking data within the framework of [XDM schemas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html#:~:text=Experience%20Data%20Model%20(XDM)%2C,the%20power%20of%20digital%20experiences). For more information, see the [Media Edge API overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge-network-server-api/media-edge-apis/overview.html).

Use case 2

* A `buffering` state.
* The user pressing `pause`.
* The user closing the app without finishing the content to the end.

In contrast to the [Media Edge API use case example with two chapters separated by an ad break](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/guides/use-cases/media-edge/chapters-with-ad-timeline/), this example presents a differing offset playhead position in the timeline.

Adobe may add optional request and response members (name/value pairs) to existing API objects at any time and without notice or changes in versioning. Adobe recommends that you refer to the API documentation of any third-party tool you integrate with our APIs so that such additions are ignored in processing if not understood. If implemented properly, such additions are non-breaking changes for your implementation.
