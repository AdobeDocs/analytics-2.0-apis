# Use cases

Once you create a project in the Adobe Developer Console and obtain the necessary authentication credentials, you can begin using the API in your desired programming language or API client.

Adobe encourages the addition of as many use cases in this section as possible. If you have a programming language or API client that you have successfully configured for use with the Analytics API, consider [contributing](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) a new page to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/tree/main/src/pages/guides/use-cases).
