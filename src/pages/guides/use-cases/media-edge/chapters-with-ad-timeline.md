# Media Edge API use case: Two chapters separated by an ad break

This guide provides a use case for tracking a media session with the Media Edge API service. The example session shown for this use case contains the following elements:

* Two chapters: `Chapter 1` and `Chapter 2`.
* An ad break inserted at the middle of the content that contains two ads: `Ad 1` and `Ad 2`.

To view a use case that includes a buffer state and a pause, see [Media Edge API use case: Buffer state and a pause](https://experienceleague.adobe.com).

Media Edge APIs are built on the Adobe Experience Platform to provide media event tracking data within the framework of [XDM schemas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html#:~:text=Experience%20Data%20Model%20(XDM)%2C,the%20power%20of%20digital%20experiences). For more information, see the [Media Edge API overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge-network-server-api/media-edge-apis/overview.html).

## Use case introduction

For this session, you will need to make an API request for each action that you want to track. After [configuring a datastream](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/datastreams/configure.html), you can begin tracking a session by providing the data stream ID in the following request:

POST `https://edge.adobedc.net/ee-pre-prd/va/v1/sessionStart?configId={dataStreamID}`

You can also specify session details as part of this request, including the name, length, content type, player name, channel, and app version.

### Example request to start tracking a session

The following example request shows how to start tracking a session and how to specify session details in a request:

```curl
curl -i --request POST '{uri}/ee/va/v1/sessionStart?configId={dataStreamId}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "events": [
    {
      "xdm": {
        "eventType": "media.sessionStart",
        "timestamp": "YYYY-08-01T02:00:00.000Z",
        "mediaCollection": {
          "playhead": 0,
          "sessionDetails": {
            "name": "API Example Player",
            "length": 60,
            "contentType": "VOD",
            "playerName": "example-html5-api-player",
            "channel": "example-channel",
            "appVersion": "va-api-0.0.0"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

For more information regarding how to start the session, see the [Media Edge API getting started](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge-network-server-api/media-edge-apis/getting-started.html?lang=en#:~:text=configId%3D%7Bdatastream%20ID%7D%20%5C-,Example,-request) guide.

Each subsequent request is made in the same manner, but with changes to the endpoint path, parameters, and request payload to match the action.

### Timeline of actions

The following table summarizes a timeline of actions to be tracked for this use case. Each row shows an action and its request endpoint. Each action is described in more detail with payloads below the table. The Client request column shows the final path parameter and the other parameters required to include in the call. Note that the **playhead position**, (the current position indicated in the horizontal timeline of the video) is not advanced during buffering or pausing, even though real-time has elapsed. Both **playhead position** and the passing of real time are measured in seconds.

Note that for tracking you must fire ping events every 10 seconds, tracked in real-time, beginning after 10 seconds have elapsed from the session start. This must happen regardless of other API events that you have sent. 

| # | Action | Elapsed Real-Time (from beginning in seconds) | Playhead Position (in seconds)| Client request |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The auto-play function occurs, or the Play button is pressed, and the video starts loading. | 0 | 0 | `/sessionStart?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 2 | The [ping event timer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/analytics-only/streaming-media-apis/mc-api-impl/mc-api-sed-pings.html) starts | 0 | 0 | `/ping?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 3 | Tracks the `play` event | 0 | 0 | `/play?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 4 | Tracks the start of `Chapter 1` | 1 | 1 | `/chapterStart?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 5 | Sends a ping | 10 | 10 | `/ping?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 6 | Tracks the completion of `Chapter 1` | 15 | 15 | `/chapterComplete?configId=<datastreamID>` |

| 8 | Tracks the start of `Ad 1` in ad break | 16 | 16 | `/adStart?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 9 | Sends a ping twice during `Ad 1`, each 10 seconds apart | 20,30 | 20,30 | `/ping?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 10 | Tracks completion of `Ad 1` | 31 | 31 | `/adComplete?configId=<datastreamID>` |

| 12 | Sends ping | 40 | 40 | `/ping?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 13 | Tracks completion of `Ad 2` | 43 | 43 | `/adComplete?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 14 | Tracks completion of ad break | 43 | 43 | `/adBreakComplete?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 15 | Tracks the start of `Chapter 2` | 44 | 44 | `/chapterStart?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 16 | Sends ping | 50 | 50 | `/ping?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 17 | Tracks completion of `Chapter 2`| 54 | 54 | `/chapterComplete?configId=<datastreamID>` |
| 18 | Tracks completion of session when user finishes watching the content to the end | 55 | 55 | `/sessionComplete?configId=<datastreamID>` |

### Detailed description of actions

Each timeline action shown in the previous table is described in detail below. Each description includes the payload that is sent as part of a Media Edge API.

#### 1. Start before play

| # | Action | Elapsed Real-Time (from beginning) | Playhead Position | Client request |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The auto-play function occurs or Play button is pressed and the video starts loading | 0 | 0 | `/sessionStart?configId=<datastreamID>` |

This call returns a Session ID {SID} to the client. The {SID} is used to identify all subsequent tracking calls within the session.  This call also generates a reporting event that is pushed to AEP and/or Analytics, depending on your datastream configuration. This action represents the start of the process but not yet in the *playing* state. Required parameters must be included, as shown in [endpoint reference](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge-network-server-api/media-edge-apis/swagger.html).

**Example payload**

```json
{
  "eventType": "media.sessionStart",
