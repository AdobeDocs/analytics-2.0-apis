# Data Repair API

The Data Repair API provides you with a mechanism to delete or edit certain existing Adobe Analytics data.  Repair requests are made by submitting a job definition to the Data Repair API, which includes the report suite, date range, variables and actions to be applied to the data.

The Data Repair API currently supports the following actions:

* Deleting Activity Map data
* Deleting Custom Traffic (prop) data
* Deleting Custom Conversion (eVar) data

The Data Repair API returns:

* The Server Call volume estimate for the data repair job
* The job id
* The status of a submitted job id
* A list of all data repair jobs for a report suite

>WARNING: Use of the Data Repair API permanently deletes existing Adobe Analytics data. We recommend a careful approach to executing the repair to minimize accidental deletion. Read through this document before using the Data Repair API.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Data Repair API, there are four requirements:

#### 1. Confirm Contract

The Data Repair API is a paid service.  Reach out to your Adobe Account Team for details and confirmation of your status.

#### 2.	Create a Service Account Connection within Adobe I/O

A Service Account Connection allows the Data Repair API to call Adobe services.  For information on how to set up the connection, follow the instructions described in the [Service Account Connection](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/blob/stage/AuthenticationOverview/ServiceAccountIntegration.md) documentation.   You can configure the Connection with access to the Adobe Analytics APIs.  During the process, you will generate a key pair and download the private key.  Store the API Key / Client ID associated with the Service Account Connection securely.  This is used when accessing the Data Repair API.

#### 3. Grant the Data Repair API permission to the new Service Account Connection in the Experience Cloud

Adobe Experience Cloud Admin Console includes product profile controls. Product profiles have Adobe Analytics-specific User permissions for managing integration access to reporting features and data.

The Data Repair API permission is located under the Adobe Analytics Report Suite Tools permission group.

For more information on creating profiles and managing permissions, see [Manage Products and Profiles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-products-and-profiles.html) and [Manage Permissions and Roles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-permissions-and-roles.html).
 
#### 4.	Create a JSON Web Token

In order to establish a secure service-to-service Adobe I/O API session, create a JSON Web Token (JWT) that encapsulates the identity of the product integration, and then exchange it for an access token. Every request to an Adobe service must include the access token in the `Authorization header`, along with the `API Key / Client ID` associated with the Service Account Connection.  For more information about creating a JWT access token, see [JWT Authentication](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/blob/stage/JWT/JWT.md).  For instructions on testing your JWT, see Step 3 in the  [Service Account Connection](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/blob/stage/AuthenticationOverview/ServiceAccountIntegration.md#step-3-try-it) documentation.

> NOTE: A new access token must be created before each use of the Data Repair API.

## Submit a data repair job

To submit a data repair job, there are three steps:

#### 1. Estimate repair size

The Data Repair API incurs charges based on usage.  It scans every row of data looking for repairs.   Sizing is based on rows scanned.  The `/serverCallEstimate` endpoint is a required step to help you estimate the cost of a repair. The `/serverCallEstimate` endpoint returns a count of the Server Call volume for the report suite date range. The endpoint also returns a `validationToken`, which is required for the job creation call.

#### 2. Create repair

To create a data repair job, use the `/job` endpoint. This endpoint requires a Report Suite, date range, `validationToken` (from `/serverCallEstimate`), and a job definition, which specifies the variables to be repaired.  

#### 3. Monitor progress

When a repair job is created, a Job ID will be returned. The `/job/{JOB_ID}` endpoint can be used to monitor the status of a job at any point after job submission.

Completion of a repair job may take hours to days.

## Server Call Estimate

The /serverCallEstimate endpoint calculates the number of Server Calls for the given Report Suite and date range provided.  It also returns `validationToken`, which is will be passed to `/job` in the `validationToken` query string parameter. The Server Call volume can be multiplied by the CPMM rate found in the Data Repair API Sales Order. This calculation provides an estimate of the cost of the data repair job. The date range is specified in days and is based on the time zone of the Report Suite. The date range is inclusive of the start and end dates for estimates and repairs.

The `ANALYTICS_GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID` can be found in Adobe Analytics > Admin > Company Settings > API Access.  Look for the bold text value in the second sentence.

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET -H "accept: application/json" -H "x-proxy-global-company-id: {ANALYTICS_GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" -H "x-api-key: {API_KEY/CLIENT_ID}" \
    "https://analytics.adobe.io/api/{ANALYTICS_GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID}/datarepair/v1/{REPORT_SUITE_ID}/serverCallEstimate?dateRangeStart={YYYY-MM-DD}&dateRangeEnd={YYYY-MM-DD}"
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
    "dateRangeEnd": "2019-03-28",
    "dateRangeStart": "2019-03-28",
    "reportSuiteId": "sample.reportsuite",
    "serverCallEstimate": 150000,
    "validationToken": "gAAAAABee777APCKafp7zDu-I3kFIEq_4AoeZSIap8wt0RhgNHmVdjnlrKCjPOo_PW74uj0qvDPG9B_SiYOe4p1Rg6Um1vCpL7dLwtkBX7i8wNheVPhb2j4nAapE-k6WPVcdP7FXNdjKvogMwHBEvGpAz6uO6TmpxwZUa3LMixaeN65BOFZW3i9ZnzZ400oCHte6XAX6Mo7QF-PyZZ6D--693K0cO_oUYg=="
}
```

## Job Creation

The `/job` endpoint creates the data repair job. A JSON-formatted Job Definition is passed in as the POST body and a Job ID is returned. 

The `/job` endpoint uses the `validationToken` from the `/serverCallEstimate` endpoint to confirm that its parameters are the same as those passed to `/serverCallEstimate`. If the parameters do not match or the Server Call volume has changed significantly between the call to `/serverCallEstimate` and the call to `/job`, the Data Repair API will return an error.

If the scope of the data repair job changes, re-run the `/serverCallEstimate` endpoint to generate a new `validationToken`.

> WARNING: Use of the Data Repair API permanently deletes existing Adobe Analtyics data. Follow the recommended workflow for testing and validation prior to applying any data repair jobs to production data.

#### Job Definition

The job definition is used to specify the variables you want to repair and what actions to take on those variables.  The definition format follows this pattern:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "{VARIABLE_1}": {
      "action": "{ACTION_1}"
    },
    "{VARIABLE_2}": {
      "action": "{ACTION_2}"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Variables
The following variables are available for deletion via the Data Repair API:
* Activity Map
    * The Activity Map variable includes `clickmappage`, `clickmaplink`, `clickmapregion`, and as well as the context data used to populate these identities
* Props (Custom Traffic Variables)
    * Custom Traffic Property variables (commonly referred to as 'props') are referenced by number -- for example `prop3` or `prop27`; props are numbered from 1 to 75
* eVars (Custom Conversion Variables)
    * Custom Conversion variables (commonly referred to as 'eVars') are referenced by number -- for example `evar7` or `evar173`; eVars are numbered from 1 to 250
    * An eVar value may exist across multiple hits or sessions depending on the "Expire After" setting for the eVar.  Consequently, when repairing an eVar, it is important to check the expiration setting (and potentially use the "Reset" option for that eVar) to avoid historical data "re-populating" the variable. To force client-side eVar values to be cleared, utilize the Reset setting for the eVar. You can read more about eVar expiration and Reset settings in the [Conversion Variables documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/admin-tools/conversion-variables/conversion-var-admin.html).

##### Actions
The following actions are available for the variables mentioned above: 
* Delete
    * All values for the specified variable are deleted for the indicated timeframe

#### Example Repair Job Definition
The following *Repair Job Definition* is an example of how a Data Repair Request would be formatted to delete data from Activity Map, prop12, evar74, and evar107:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "activitymap": {
      "action": "delete"
    },
    "prop12": {
      "action": "delete"
    },
    "evar74": {
      "action": "delete"
    },
    "evar107": {
      "action": "delete"
    }
  }
}
``` 

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST -H "accept: application/json" -H "x-proxy-global-company-id: {ANALYTICS_GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" -H "x-api-key: {API_KEY/CLIENT_ID}" -d '{REPAIR_JOB_DEFINITION}' \
    "https://analytics.adobe.io/api/{ANALYTICS_GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID}/datarepair/v1/{REPORT_SUITE_ID}/job?validationToken={VALIDATION_TOKEN}&dateRangeStart={YYYY-MM-DD}&dateRangeEnd={YYYY-MM-DD}"
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
    "dateRangeEnd": "2019-03-28",
    "dateRangeStart": "2019-03-28",
    "jobCompleteTime": null,
    "jobCreateTime": "2020-03-24T09:02:59+00:00",
    "jobDefinition": {
        "variables": {
            "activitymap": {
                "action": "delete"
            },
            "prop12": {
                "action": "delete"
            },
            "evar74": {
                "action": "delete"
            },
            "evar107": {
                "action": "delete"
            }
        }
    },
    "jobId": 24,
    "progress": 0,
    "reportSuiteId": "sample.reportsuite",
    "serverCalls": null,
    "status": "processing"
}

```

## Job Status

The `/job/{JOB_ID}` endpoint is called to check on the progress of a data repair job.  Following submission of a job, `status` will report as `processing` and `progress` will be a number between `0` and `100`.  Once complete, `status` will report as `complete` and `serverCalls` will be set to the actual number of Server Calls scanned during the data repair job. This `serverCalls` value will be used to calculate usage.

Completion of a repair job may take hours to days.

#### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET -H "accept: application/json" -H "x-proxy-global-company-id: {ANALYTICS_GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" -H "x-api-key: {API_KEY/CLIENT_ID}" \
    "https://analytics.adobe.io/api/{ANALYTICS_GLOBAL_COMPANY_ID}/datarepair/v1/{REPORT_SUITE_ID}/job/{JOB_ID}"
```

#### Example Response

            },
            "evar74": {
                "action": "delete"
            },
            "evar107": {
                "action": "delete"
            }
        }

    "progress": 100,
    "reportSuiteId": "sample.reportsuite",
    "serverCalls": 2,
    "status": "complete"
}
```

## Recommended Workflow

The Data Repair API permanently deletes or edits existing data.  The following workflow provides multiple checkpoints to minimize the risk of accidental data deletion.  Review the data after each step to confirm the data repair job completes as expected.
 
Create a repair job in the following:
1. A **development** Report Suite for **one day** of data.
2. A **development** Report Suite for **one month** of data.
3. A **production** Report Suite for **one day** of data.
4. A **production** Report Suite for **one month** of data.
5. Once all testing and validation is complete, then proceed with the **full date range** of the data repair for **production** data.

## Usage Notes

1. WARNING: Use of the Data Repair API permanently deletes existing Adobe Analytics data. We recommend a careful approach to executing the repair to minimize accidental deletion. Read through this document before using the Data Repair API.

1. While the Data Repair process is running, it is possible for an Adobe Analytics report -- referencing the same variable indicated in the Data Repair job and across the same timeframe -- to temporarily return "Unspecified" for the variable in question. Once the Data Repair job is complete, the values returned by Adobe Analytics (and not removed by the Data Repair process) will display normally.

1. Because segmentations and classifications rely on variable values, it is important to review dependencies on variable values before repairing data to prevent unexpected changes.

1. An eVar value may exist across multiple hits or sessions depending on the "Expire After" setting for the eVar.  Consequently, when repairing an eVar, it is important to check the expiration setting (and potentially use the "Reset" option for that eVar) to avoid historical data "re-populating" the variable. To force client-side eVar values to be cleared, utilize the Reset setting for the eVar. You can read more about eVar expiration and Reset settings in the [Conversion Variables documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/admin-tools/conversion-variables/conversion-var-admin.html). 

## Limitations

1. The Data Repair API job date ranges cannot include the current month.  They must start within the last 36 months and end prior to the current month.

1. The Data Repair API does not currently support jobs for report suites enabled with Cross-Device Analytics.

1. The Data Repair API does not currently support jobs involving variables with merchandising enabled.

1. Only one job at a time can be running per report suite.
