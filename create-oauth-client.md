## Creating an OAuth client

To work with Analytics 2.0 APIs on the Adobe I/O Console, you need to have System Admin rights for your organization. When you receive notification of these rights, click the **Get Started** button in the message to access services.

To create an OAuth client:

1. Navigate to the following URL: https://console.adobe.io/integrations.

2. Click the `New Integration` button.

3. Select the `Access an API` option and then click `Continue`.

4. Under the Experience Cloud section select `Adobe Analytics` and then select `OAuth integration` and then click `Continue`.

5. Select `New integration` and then click `Continue`.

6. Fill out the name, description and other fields and then click `Create Integration`.

Your client is now created. Notice your client has an `Client ID (API Key)` and a `Client Secret`. These will be needed to get your auth code and to generate access tokens.
