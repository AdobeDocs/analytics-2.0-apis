# Analytics 2.0 APIs
Documentation for the analytics 2.0 APIs

This documentation provides instructions for Adobe Analytics 2.0 APIs. For working with Analytics 1.4 APIs, see [Analytics 1.4 API Documentation](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis).

The Adobe Analytics APIs are a collection of APIs that power Adobe Analytics products like Analysis Workspace. The APIs allow for the creation of data rich user interfaces that you can use to manipulate and integrate data. You can also create reports to explore, get insights, or answer important questions about your data.
