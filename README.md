It is assumed that you have an understanding of the Adobe Analytics product, its features and capabilities and know how to use the product. Thus an introduction to Adobe Analytics, is outside of the scope of this guide.

The Adobe Analytics APIs are a collection of APIs that power Adobe Analytics products like Analysis Workspace. The APIs allow for the creation of data rich user interfaces that customers can use to slice and dice their data. Customers can create reports that explore their data and can get insights into their data or answer important questions about their data.  

We have a BETA version of our [Swagger UI](https://adobedocs.github.io/analytics-2.0-apis/) available to help you learn how to use the APIs. The Swagger UI currently only supports Adobe ID authentication.
